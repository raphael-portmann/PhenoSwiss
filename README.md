# Calibration winter wheat heading dates using WOFOST-PHENOLOGY for Swiss varieties


This project calibrates the WOFOST phenology model (Wofost72_Phenology) to simulate the heading and maturity dates of Swiss winter wheat varieties. It uses observational data from 2000-2018 from a range of Swiss field sites \[Source: Dario Fossati, Agroscope; Data used in \[Rogger et al. 2021\](<ins>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030121001659</ins>)\] to calibrate the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis (TSUM1) and from anthesis to maturity (TSUM2).
