# Calibration winter wheat heading dates using WOFOST-PHENOLOGY for Swiss wheat varieties (PhenoSwiss)


This project calibrates the WOFOST phenology model (Wofost72_Phenology) to simulate the heading and maturity dates of Swiss winter wheat varieties. It uses observational data from 2000-2018 from a range of Swiss field sites \[Source: Dario Fossati, Agroscope; Data used in [Rogger et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030121001659) to calibrate the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis (TSUM1) and from anthesis to maturity (TSUM2). Phenological data are not provided in this repository.

Any further developments of this project happen in [this repository](https://github.com/raphael-portmann/winter_wheat_phenology) which is a further development of PhenoSwiss and the winter wheat phenology study of Lukas Graf, which can be found  [here](https://github.com/EOA-team/winter_wheat_phenology)
